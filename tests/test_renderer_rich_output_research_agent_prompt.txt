 1 Read the question carefully - What specific information does the user need? 
 2 Start with broader searches - Use broad, comprehensive queries first        
 3 After each search, pause and assess - Do I have enough to answer? What's    
   still missing?                                                              
 4 Execute narrower searches as you gather information - Fill in the gaps      
 5 Stop when you can answer confidently - Don't keep searching for perfection  


Stop Immediately When:
