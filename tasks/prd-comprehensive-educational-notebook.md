# Product Requirements Document: Comprehensive Educational Research Notebook

## Introduction/Overview

This PRD defines the creation of a highly educational Jupyter notebook that demonstrates a complete multi-agent research system. The notebook will serve as a comprehensive learning resource that combines the full functionality from existing notebooks (5_full_agent.ipynb), MCP integration concepts (3_research_agent_mcp.ipynb), and test-synchronized examples (0_consolidated_research_agent.ipynb).

The notebook will teach developers how to build sophisticated AI research systems while maintaining synchronization with the existing test suite. It addresses the need for a single, well-documented reference that demonstrates the impact of prompts, LLMs, and LLM settings on final research results.

## Goals

1. **Educational Excellence**: Create a comprehensive learning resource that teaches multi-agent research system development
2. **Test Synchronization**: Maintain perfect alignment between notebook demonstrations and test suite validation
3. **End-to-End Demonstration**: Show complete workflow from bootstrap through final report generation
4. **Technology Integration**: Demonstrate LangGraph, MCP, and various LLM providers working together
5. **Reproducible Learning**: Ensure all examples use existing packages and mock implementations for deterministic results

## User Stories

**As a junior developer**, I want to understand how multi-agent research systems work so that I can build similar systems.

**As an experienced developer**, I want to see how different LLM settings and prompts impact research quality so that I can optimize my own implementations.

**As a student**, I want step-by-step explanations with diagrams so that I can understand the architecture and data flow.

**As a researcher**, I want to see how MCP integration works in practice so that I can incorporate external tools into my research workflows.

**As a team lead**, I want the notebook to stay synchronized with tests so that documentation remains accurate and up-to-date.

7.5. Demonstrate debugging techniques

## Non-Goals (Out of Scope)

- Advanced optimization techniques beyond educational benchmarking
- Production deployment considerations
- Complex UI components beyond Rich output
- Adding unrelated vendor integrations outside the demo scope. Using external services that the demos rely on (SerpAPI, Tavily, LangGraph tools, MCP servers, LangSmith) is in-scope when clearly labeled and configured via env vars.

## Design Considerations

### Notebook Structure

- **Markdown Cells**: Detailed explanations before each code section
- **Code Cells**: Well-commented, educational implementations
- **Output Cells**: Rich-formatted results with explanations
- **Diagrams**: Mermaid diagrams for architecture and flow visualization

### Code Style

- Comprehensive comments explaining each step
- Docstrings following Python conventions
- Type hints used throughout; keep the notebook Pylance-clean and treat warnings as actionable
- Prefer Pythonic naming (PEP 8) even if different from legacy names in the codebase

### Educational Approach

- Progressive complexity (simple to advanced)
- Real-world examples and scenarios
- Side-by-side comparisons
- Troubleshooting sections
- Best practices callouts
- When pedagogical trade-offs arise, confirm the approach with the user before finalizing

## Technical Considerations

### Dependencies

- Use packages already present in the project
- Include both live provider integrations and mocks for parity:
  - SerpAPI (live) alongside `SerpAPISearchAdapter` mocks
  - Tavily (live) alongside `TavilySearchAdapter` mocks
  - LangGraph tools and MCP servers where applicable (stdio/http)
  - LangSmith tracing for observability
- Accessing external services is expected; credentials supplied via environment variables. Live-call sections will be clearly labeled and have mock fallbacks.
- Follow established patterns from existing notebooks

### Mock Implementations

- Use MockLLM for deterministic LLM responses
- Use MockSearchAdapter for consistent search results
- Use in-process MCP stubs for tool operations
- Provide toggles to switch between live providers and mocks

### Synchronization Strategy

- Mirror test cases in notebook examples
- Use same data structures and models
- Follow same error handling patterns
- Maintain version alignment between notebook and tests
- Each non-trivial notebook code path must be backed by passing pytest and (where applicable) Hypothesis tests to prevent regressions.

#### Notebook-to-Test Mapping

- Provide a lightweight mapping within the notebook (markdown) from sections/cells to corresponding tests (e.g., "Section 3.2 ↔ tests/test_research_agent.py::test_run_uses_mockllm").
- For live-service examples, include a mock-mode variant that maps to existing deterministic tests.

## Success Metrics

1. **Educational Value**: Notebook successfully teaches multi-agent research system concepts
2. **Test Alignment**: 100% synchronization between notebook examples and test cases
3. **Reproducibility**: Examples run deterministically under mocks; live-provider sections clearly marked
4. **Completeness**: Covers entire research workflow from bootstrap to final report
5. **Clarity**: Clear explanations and diagrams make complex concepts understandable
6. **Observability**: LangSmith tracing and structured logs enabled; assertions (assertpy) validate expectations

## Open Questions

1. Performance benchmarking: Yes. Include simple latency/throughput comparisons for mock vs. live providers, and LLM setting impacts.
2. MCP protocol depth: Keep implementation light; provide references/links in markdown rather than deep protocol details.
3. Failure modes and recovery: No. Omit for this iteration.
4. Version updates and synchronization: Pending — define a lightweight checklist or CI check to flag drift between notebook and tests.
5. Exercises vs demos: Demo-only; no exercises.

## Implementation Notes

- Start with bootstrap and setup sections
- Build up complexity gradually through workflow stages
- Include rich output formatting for better readability
- Use existing test fixtures as data sources
- Backward compatibility with earlier notebooks is NOT required
- Add LangSmith tracing hooks and extensive logging; include assertpy validations alongside outputs
