5. WHEN templates are rendered THEN the system SHALL display both the context and the rendered output for educational clarity

### Requirement 4: Multi-Agent Research Workflow

**User Story:** As a researcher using the system, I want to submit a human prompt that gets automatically scoped and then processed by a supervisor coordinating multiple specialized agents so that I can get comprehensive research results without manual orchestration.

#### Acceptance Criteria — Req 4

1. WHEN a human prompt is submitted THEN the system SHALL use LLM to ask at least one clarifying question and loop with human to gain clarification
2. WHEN scoping is complete THEN the system SHALL generate a research brief that guides subsequent agent work
3. WHEN research begins THEN the system SHALL use a supervisor agent to coordinate multiple specialized research agents
4. WHEN agents are deployed THEN the system SHALL support both in-process and MCP agent types working together
5. WHEN research is complete THEN the system SHALL generate a comprehensive final report and use MCP local file access to save the final report

### Requirement 5: MCP Integration Support

**User Story:** As a developer exploring different agent architectures, I want to see how MCP (Model Context Protocol) agents can be integrated alongside in-process agents so that I can understand the trade-offs and implementation patterns.

#### Acceptance Criteria — Req 5

1. WHEN MCP is available THEN the system SHALL demonstrate filesystem MCP server integration for local document access
2. WHEN MCP tools are used THEN the system SHALL show proper async/await patterns required by the MCP protocol
3. WHEN MCP is unavailable THEN the system SHALL gracefully fall back to in-process alternatives
4. WHEN demonstrating MCP THEN the system SHALL explain the client-server architecture and transport types (stdio vs HTTP)
5. WHEN MCP agents run THEN the system SHALL show how they integrate with the supervisor alongside in-process agents

### Requirement 6: Educational Content and Progression

**User Story:** As someone learning AI agent development, I want the notebook to progress from basic concepts to advanced multi-agent coordination so that I can build understanding incrementally.

#### Acceptance Criteria — Req 6

1. WHEN following the notebook THEN the system SHALL present concepts in logical progression from models to agents to coordination
2. WHEN demonstrating features THEN the system SHALL include comprehensive markdown cells before all code cells with paragraphs, links, images, and lists explaining concepts
3. WHEN showing code examples THEN the system SHALL include detailed code comments describing all code blocks and their purpose
4. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL provide educational error handling with clear explanations
5. WHEN advanced features are shown THEN the system SHALL reference simpler concepts demonstrated earlier

### Requirement 7: Test Coverage Alignment

**User Story:** As a developer validating the framework, I want the notebook demonstrations to align with the test suite so that I can trust the examples and understand the expected behavior.

#### Acceptance Criteria — Req 7

1. WHEN adding new functionality THEN the system SHALL create new tests that consistently pass alongside existing tests
2. WHEN demonstrating functionality THEN the system SHALL keep notebook examples in sync with the test suite
3. WHEN showing property-based testing THEN the system SHALL include Hypothesis examples for key invariants
4. WHEN demonstrating adapters THEN the system SHALL show from_raw construction, empty-limit behavior, and raw preservation
5. WHEN testing edge cases THEN the system SHALL demonstrate error handling for invalid inputs

### Requirement 8: Interactive Research Execution

**User Story:** As a user of the research system, I want to input a research question and see the complete workflow execute with visible intermediate steps so that I can understand how the system processes my request.

#### Acceptance Criteria — Req 8

1. WHEN I input a research prompt THEN the system SHALL use LangGraph's Command object and interrupt() instead of conditional nodes and standard input
2. WHEN scoping is complete THEN the system SHALL display the generated research brief
3. WHEN research begins THEN the system SHALL show supervisor decision-making and agent assignment
4. WHEN agents work THEN the system SHALL display their individual research findings and tool usage
5. WHEN research concludes THEN the system SHALL show the final report generation process

### Requirement 9: Robust Error Handling and Fallbacks

**User Story:** As someone running the notebook in different environments, I want the system to handle missing dependencies or configuration issues gracefully so that I can still learn from the parts that work.

#### Acceptance Criteria — Req 9

1. WHEN imports fail THEN the system SHALL continue with available functionality and show helpful messages
2. WHEN MCP servers are unavailable THEN the system SHALL fall back to mock implementations
3. WHEN network resources are unavailable THEN the system SHALL use local mock data for demonstrations
4. WHEN environment variables are missing THEN the system SHALL use safe defaults with super clear and minimal error messages prioritizing educational control over production-readiness
5. WHEN async operations fail THEN the system SHALL provide clear guidance on notebook-specific async handling

### Requirement 10: Evaluation and Quality Assurance

**User Story:** As a researcher using the system, I want evaluations to run at key points in the workflow to ensure quality of results so that I can trust the research findings and identify areas for improvement.

#### Acceptance Criteria — Req 10

1. WHEN scoping is complete THEN the system SHALL evaluate the research brief against user criteria using BRIEF_CRITERIA_PROMPT and BRIEF_HALLUCINATION_PROMPT
2. WHEN individual agents complete research THEN the system SHALL evaluate research quality and completeness before compression
3. WHEN supervisor makes decisions THEN the system SHALL evaluate agent assignment and coordination effectiveness
4. WHEN final report is generated THEN the system SHALL evaluate report comprehensiveness and source citation quality
5. WHEN evaluations fail THEN the system SHALL provide clear feedback and allow for iteration or correction

### Requirement 11: Performance and Scalability Considerations

**User Story:** As someone running complex research workflows, I want the system to handle resource management and provide guidance on scaling considerations so that I can understand production deployment patterns.

#### Acceptance Criteria — Req 11

1. WHEN running long research workflows THEN the system SHALL set appropriate recursion limits (50+) for complex multi-agent scenarios
2. WHEN demonstrating async operations THEN the system SHALL use nest_asyncio for Jupyter compatibility
3. WHEN showing resource usage THEN the system SHALL demonstrate proper cleanup of MCP clients and connections
